// Compiler-specific treatment for C99's stdint.h
//
// By default, this header will use the standard headers (so it
// is your responsibility to make sure they are available), except
// on MSVC before Visual Studio 2010, when they were not provided.
// To support old MSVC, a few of the commonly-used definitions are
// provided here.  If more definitions are needed, add them here,
// or replace these definitions with a complete implementation,
// such as the ones available from Google, Boost, or MSVC10.  You
// can prevent the definition of any of these types (in order to
// use your own) by #defining CU_STDINT_TYPES_ALREADY_DEFINED.

#if !defined(CU_STDINT_TYPES_ALREADY_DEFINED)

// In VS including stdint.h forces the C++ runtime dep - provide an opt-out
// (CU_STDINT_VS_FORCE_NO_STDINT_H) for users that care (notably static
// cudart).

// These definitions can be used with MSVC 8 and 9,
// which don't ship with stdint.h:

// C code with DJGPP, which only provides stdint.h
// when compiling C++ code with TR1 enabled.
