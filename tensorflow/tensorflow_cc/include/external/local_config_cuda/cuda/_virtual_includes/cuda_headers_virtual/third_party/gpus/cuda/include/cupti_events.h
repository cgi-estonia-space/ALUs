 * \brief For a set of events, get the grouping that indicates the

 *
 * The number of events that can be collected simultaneously varies by
 * device and by the type of the events. When events can be collected
 * simultaneously, they may need to be grouped into multiple event
 * groups because they are from different event domains. This function
 * takes a set of events and determines how many passes are required
 * to collect all those events, and which events can be collected
 * simultaneously in each pass.
 *
 * The CUpti_EventGroupSets returned in \p eventGroupPasses indicates
 * how many passes are required to collect the events with the \p
 * numSets field. Within each event group set, the \p sets array
 * indicates the event groups that should be collected on each pass.
 * \note \b Thread-safety: this function is thread safe, but client
 * must guard against another thread simultaneously destroying \p
 * context.
